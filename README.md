<h1>Take Notes</h1>

<h3>Note taking can turn cumbersome with increase in size and variety of types of notes.</h3>

Not every note is plain text, that can be copy pasted everywhere, you can have variety of types of notes such as
<ul>
  <li>Contacts</li>
  <li>Locations</li>
  <li>Transactions</li>
  <li>Events</li>
  and lot more....

</ul>

This app allows you to create note contexts which can be related to an event, a workshop, a visit or just casual info to take a peek at during preparation...

For example, you have a meeting with one of your clients, now you need to keep critical information handy about the client, for example
<Li>his likes, dislikes,</li>
  <li>his contact number, </li>
    <li>a step through guide for your overall presentation, </li>
    <Li>all the points you need to cover and ofcourse the meeting location, </li>
    <li>maybe an image too.</li>


So , what you do is you create a note context " meeting with client " add all fields of image, contact, location and lots more , compile it and refer to it as per your requirement.

All the notes are stored on local storage so very easily accessible and ready to use.
